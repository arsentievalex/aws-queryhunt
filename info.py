# QueryHunt - SQL Murder Mystery Game üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**QueryHunt** is an interactive SQL game that combines the excitement of a murder mystery with the power of AI. Inspired by the original [SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/), this project challenges players to solve a unique case by running SQL queries against AI-generated data. Built as a hackathon project for [AWS Game Builder Challenge](https://awsdevchallenge.devpost.com/) , QueryHunt uses multiple AWS services, such as Bedrock, RSD and S3.

## Features

- **Engaging Gameplay:** Players use SQL queries to explore data and identify the murderer in a dynamically generated story.
- **AI-Powered Hints:** An AI assistant provides hints based on previous queries to guide players toward the correct solution.
- **Cutting-Edge Tech Stack:** The game leverages Claude 3.5 Sonnet through AWS Bedrock, Llama-Index and Streamlit to deliver a smooth and modern experience.
- **Scalable and Unique:** Each game session is unique, with new stories and data generated every time, ensuring a fresh challenge for every player.

## How It Works

1. **Story Generation:** The AI generates a unique murder mystery story and populates the database with relevant data.
2. **Data Exploration:** Players explore the data by running SQL queries to piece together the clues and identify the murderer.
3. **Hints System:** The AI can offer hints based on the player‚Äôs query history, helping them narrow down the suspects.
4. **Victory:** The game ends when the player correctly identifies the murderer.
